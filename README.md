# Manglish

## What does it do?

This is a project to provide English to Malyalam transliteration or simply said it converts manglish to malaylam. Have a look at the [website](krishnanunnir.github.io/manglish/);

## How this works?

This is a front end to the varnam project with integrated autocomplete. The varnam project api is providing the suggestions, while tribute.js is used to render it as autocomplete in the front end.

## Based on

1. [varnam project](https://github.com/varnamproject/varnamd) - on the backend the suggestions are based on the api hosted by the varnam project
2. [Trix WYSIWYG editor](https://github.com/basecamp/trix)
3. [tribute.js](https://github.com/zurb/tribute)
